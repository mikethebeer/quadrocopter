# Quadrocopter Firmware

This repo contains the firmware of a quadrocopter that can be driven by 4 or 
more rotors. It controls and holds its position in an area/room autonomous and 
without any manual adjustment. The measurement of its position is done in 
real-time by fetching values from its mounted accelerometers.
